# Earth's Closet
A chrome extension that helps users make more conscious and sustainable choice during online shopping of cloths. 

## Inspiration
We were interested in seeing how specific items had an impact on our earth and what we could do differently to reduce negative impacts. We were interested after seeing that H&M had faced a lawsuit about false sustainability claims. However, if you have something that truly shows you how sustainable or unsustainable something is, you become more aware of your choices and where you buy from.

## What it does
This google extension is intended to inspect the current product a user is viewing and using the material make up of the product, give a material sustainability index. The material sustainability index is a number that represents how sustainable a product is based on the materials used. The closer to 100, the more sustainable the product is.

## How we built it
We used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build it. We attempted web scraping by looking at different resources that ran through it.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges when attempting to web scrape. We never found out how to properly do it. :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a google extension, something we had never done before. We both do not have a lot of front-end experience, so it was nice to have created at least a graphic for a google extension.  

## What we learned
we learned that web scraping is very useful but can be tricky to work with. Neither of us had heard of web scraping before this, so it was interesting to learn about and attempt.

## What's next for Earth's Closet
We are hoping to get it to work eventually. Hopefully add some cooler aspects such as adding in more sustainable alternative solutions, like listing an item that is currently being sold second-hand, either identical to what the user is looking for or similar.
